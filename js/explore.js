// Release 4: Write a reverse function
// Declare a function that takes in a string as a parameter
// Declare an empty string variable reversedString
// Create the for loop, where the index is set at the last letter
//      - as long as the index is greater or equal to 0 (the first letter) it will run
//      - for each letter in the string, it will be added to reversedString starting with the last
// return the reversedString
