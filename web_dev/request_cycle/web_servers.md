###What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
The Linux operating system was built on the belief that users are computer literate, and know what they are doing on the command line. Users have access to and can control the operating system without boundaries. Which is both a positive (users can do clever things), and a negative (users can do stupid things).
Unlike Windows who's philosophy is based on the belief that users don't need the full scope of the system and should be protected from the deep complexity. Mac OS takes a similar shielded route but they present the system in a Graphical desktop. They both provide a command line interface for the user to communicate to the operating system but is limited. 

###What is a VPS (virtual private server)? What are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS is a virtual machine/server that hosts a remote server for users. A VPS runs it's own copy of an operating software which is up to the owner/super users disgression, and has it's own disc space storage. VPS's are easy to run, access and create online, and many hosting sites have cheap plans. The ability to store and run programs remotely is an advantage for a user who may need to upsize their space. 

###Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
The root user has access to all permissions in Linux so any programs running as them are running with root priviledges, which leaves the system open to viruses. Also, being root user means you have all permissions so any click is allowed and can have harmful effects e.g. deleting files.
