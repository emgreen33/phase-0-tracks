<!-- Reflection:
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
They’re useful in formatting the page specifically to certain areas and allow css to interact in more uniformed ways. I consider the main and the nav tags to be extremely useful in coordinating the website and allowing the structure to flow seamlessly.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
They use CSS cascading, whereby they go most recent css to least recent but with the more specific of the CSS taking priority. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned that different versions of sublime store their snippets in different places… But besides that I will definitely be using snippets more! They make the work flow a lot quicker and the more a snippet is used the more familiar it will fee.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? I think differentiating between why you use certain html5 semantic tags vs others is still a tricky concept but I feel the more I see how other sites use them the more they will feel natural. -->
