//Release 0: Find the longest phrase
// Write a function that takes an array of words or phrases and returns the longest word or phrase in the array.
//So if we gave your function the array of ["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], it would return "longest phrase".
//This is a logical reasoning challenge. Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.
// Add driver code that tests your function on a few arrays.

//Pseudocode:
// Declare a function longestPhrase that will take in an array of strings
// Declare a new variable, longest, that is set initially at null and will be updated
// Set index at 0, until the index is equal to the length of the array-1 iterate through
            // For each phrase in the array,
                    // If the next phrase is longer than the longest variable,
                            // Update the longest variable
                     // Else leave it unchanged
// Return the longest phrase variable
